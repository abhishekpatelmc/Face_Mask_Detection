**About**   
The hottest topic in the industry is computer vision, similar to humans, computers can also see and take a decision.

In this project, we will build a model to detect whether a person is wearing mask in real-time. We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using the OpenCV library and Keras

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Do you want to master deep learning, work on these amazing Deep Learning projects.
