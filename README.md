# About   

In this project, we will build a model to detect whether a person is 
wearing mask in real-time. We will do this using the 
concepts of computer vision using the OpenCV library and Keras

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) 
that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is 
unstructured or unlabeled. Do you want to master deep learning, work on these amazing 
Deep Learning projects.

## Installation

Windows:

```sh
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage example

This project can be be used in public to detect if the person is wearning the mask or not.

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
python train.py
python test.py
```
